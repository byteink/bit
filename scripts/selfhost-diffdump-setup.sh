  # `--dump-types`/`--dump-ir`/`--dump-ir-pre` through `loadProject` for prelude
  # injection (compiler/main.bit's `checkedSourceFile`, replacing a scratch module
  # with `prelude: -1` that never touched stdRoot), and the pin was not carried
  # over here with it.
  #
  # Unpinned, stage0.sh's wrapper hands the ORACLE an absolute BIT_STDLIB while
  # BIT2 runs bare and `stdRootPath` (compiler/mainpaths.bit) falls through
  # `resolveNearExe` -- there is no `bit-out/stdlib` -- to the cwd-relative
  # literal `"stdlib"`. `loadModuleAt` (compiler/project.bit) memoises on
  # `pathResolve(dir)`, which is LEXICAL and never absolutises, so for a corpus
  # file under `stdlib/core/` the relative spelling makes the prelude's key and
  # the root's key the SAME STRING: the root load hits the prelude's cached
  # module and its `rootOnly` filter is dropped, dumping the whole two-file
  # module against its concatenated source. That is one compiler disagreeing with
  # ITSELF about an environment, scored as a divergence between two compilers
  # (#5356: stdlib/core/core.bit and stdlib/core/option.bit, MISMATCH=2 from a
  # bare shell while `./make test-differentials` -- which exports BIT_STDLIB per
  # tools/build/gatestable2.bit -- read green).

  # (mutation-proven for GENERIC_EXPLODE: without it every generic declaration
  # with an explodable parameter, _tests_/cases/run_generic_arg_ok.bit and 40
  # others, mismatches in ir and iropt). DCE_METHODS changes emitted method
  # tables, invisible to a plain `--dump-ir` text diff; forcing it keeps both
