#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/gate.sh — diff-scoped test gate (#1795).
#
# `./make test` runs all 28 harnesses (~270-450s). Most changes only touch
# one area of the tree, so most of that time is wasted proving things that
# could not have broken. This script looks at what actually changed and runs
# only the steps that area needs — falling back to the full suite whenever
# the change is ambiguous. It never silently skips a test: any change it
# cannot confidently scope runs the full suite instead.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gate.sh                    # scope to `main...HEAD` PLUS the working tree
#   RANGE=HEAD~1..HEAD scripts/gate.sh # use a different range (the working tree is
#                                      # still included on top of it)
#   scripts/gate.sh --full             # always run the full `./make test`
#   scripts/gate.sh --x64              # route the computed build steps through
#                                      # scripts/x64gate.sh (real x86_64 hardware)
#   scripts/gate.sh --arm64            # route the computed build steps through
#                                      # scripts/arm64gate.sh (native aarch64-linux)
#
# BUCKETS: a change confined to exactly one of compiler/, runtime/,
# tests/cases/, examples/, stdlib/ runs only that area's minimal steps. A
# change touching any OTHER path (tools/build/, spec/, docs/, or
# anything else unlisted), or spanning MORE THAN ONE of those five areas, is
# ambiguous and always runs the full `./make test` — never a partial skip.
#
# selfhost and examples pull in a non-`./make` diff script
# (selfhost-diffcheck.sh/selfhost-fixpoint.sh, selfhost-diffexamples.sh).
# Under --x64/--arm64 only the `./make` portion runs remotely; those diff
# scripts always run locally, because they need both compilers already built
# on this machine, not merely the remote target's build steps.

# definition while HEAD *is* main. So the default invocation on main, with
# `compiler/**` modified and sitting right there, printed "nothing to test" and

# `full` REPLACES a bucket whenever the change spans more than one or touches

# It was neither. `full` ran `./make test` and nothing else, while `selfhost`
# ran three differential scripts `./make test` does not contain — so adding one
# unrelated file to a compiler/** change made the gate STRICTLY WEAKER, behind a
# green GATE_RESULT=PASS. Measured on #2084, whose change set was two
# compiler/** files plus tests/bit/golden.bit (#2194).
#
# So the invariant is CHECKED rather than trusted, in the same spirit as the
# stale-step-name check below: adding a script to any bucket without adding it
# to `full` fails here, before a single step runs. Existence is checked too —
# a renamed script is the #1593 class of silent hole.
